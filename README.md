# Pokemon_api

### Functionality
My attempt to demonstrate some skills I have acquired. This repository gets its data by making calls to the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/). Currently when the script is run (in a terminal) it will show the basic stats of the pokemon, providing they exist within the API.


### Commands
+ Run the commands below to successfully run the script (macOS) - assuming you have python installed on your device.

Create a virtual environment

```python3 -m venv venv```

Activate the virtual environment

```source activate venv```

Install requirements for the scripts to run

```pip install -r requirements```

Run Script

```python3 build_team.py```
